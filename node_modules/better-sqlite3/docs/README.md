# better-sqlite3 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3)

The fastest and simplest library for SQLite3 in Node.js.

- Full transaction support
- High performance, efficiency, and safety
- Easy-to-use synchronous API *(faster than an asynchronous API... yes, you read that correctly)*
- Support for user-defined functions, aggregates, and extensions
- 64-bit integers *(invisible until you need them)*

## How other libraries compare

|   |select 1 row &nbsp;`get()`&nbsp;|select 100 rows &nbsp;&nbsp;`all()`&nbsp;&nbsp;|select 100 rows `iterate()` 1-by-1|insert 1 row `run()`|insert 100 rows in a transaction|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|better-sqlite3|1x|1x|1x|1x|1x|
|[sqlite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite) and [sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3)|8.4x slower|3.7x slower|28.2x slower|3.6x slower|6.0x slower|

> You can verify these results by [running the benchmark yourself](./benchmark.md).
> *Both [npm/sqlite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite) and [npm/sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3) have nearly identical performance because they both use the [same engine](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3).*

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save better-sqlite3
```

> If you have trouble installing, check the [troubleshooting guide](./troubleshooting.md).

## Usage

```js
var Database = require('better-sqlite3');
var db = new Database('foobar.db', options);

var row = db.prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=?').get(userId);
console.log(row.firstName, row.lastName, row.email);
```

## Why should I use this instead of [node-sqlite3](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3)?

- `node-sqlite3` uses asynchronous APIs for tasks that are either CPU-bound or serialized. That's not only bad design, but it wastes tons of resources. It also causes [mutex thrashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_contention) which has devastating effects on performance.
- `node-sqlite3` exposes low-level (C language) memory management functions. `better-sqlite3` does it the JavaScript way, allowing the garbage collector to worry about memory management.
- `better-sqlite3` is simpler to use, and it provides nice utilities for some operations that are very difficult or impossible in `node-sqlite3`.
- `better-sqlite3` is much faster than `node-sqlite3` in most cases, and just as fast in all other cases.
